This repo is for the [Hack4Soc](https://unstop.com/hackathon/hack4soc-where-technology-meets-humanity-rv-college-of-engineering-rvce-bangalore-405582) hackathon conducted by RV college of engineering.

## Problem Statement
Humanity has various ongoing projects and programs, one among
which is the Library project. This project envisages setting up a mini
library in the premises of the shelter homes to inculcate the habit of
reading among the children. It forms the basis for the given problem
statement.
Currently, they manually select and recommend books to students
based on their reading level. They give students a few days to read
through the book and assess their understanding based on the
studentsâ€™ review of the book.
Each book is grouped into a particular reading level. Students who
complete reading 70% at a particular level are allowed to move to a
higher level. This is done manually.
The next book to be given to students is manually chosen by the
volunteer of the organization.

## Requirements
- Building up a digital setup dashboard on a digital platform for
library assistance
- Create standard Levels based on how much a child reads based
on Age group.
- Track what books a child is reading and on what level he is on
currently.
- Recommend strategies to improve and motivate his reading skills
to children who are not able to up the levels.
- Enable Students to give a report based on completion of a book.
- Evaluate the Student level of understanding based on his report
submission.
- Create category of books based on Student reads.
- Recommend similar books from a library of books for further
reading.
- Set a next level target for completion of book (based on his
previous level).
